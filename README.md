This study delves into the intricate dynamics of Airbnb pricing in New York City, aiming to unearth key determinants that influence listing prices and develop robust predictive models. Leveraging a dataset featuring a diverse array of Airbnb listings across the city, this research integrates variables such as geographical coordinates, room types, pricing, and amenities with additional data on rental income and transportation accessibility. Advanced machine learning techniques, including decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and support vector machines, were employed to model and predict Airbnb prices. Significant predictors identified include proximity to transit, housing type, and neighborhood characteristics. The findings emphasize the importance of utilizing sophisticated data sources and analytical methods to enhance prediction accuracy, providing valuable insights for hosts and policymakers engaged in strategic decision-making.
## Data overview
**Airbnb listings data of NYC**: The study employs a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb listings in New York City, featuring various attributes including location, room type, pricing, and reviews. This dataset is enriched with the DOF Condominium Comparable Rental Income Dataset, which provides additional insights into the rental incomes and market values across NYC neighborhoods, thereby offering a more holistic understanding of the city's rental market dynamics.  
**Transportation Data of NYC**: In theory, transportation is an important factor affecting the accommodation price. Therefore, this paper introduces some traffic data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including network density, population-weighted centroid distance to the nearest bus stop, etc. At the same time, there are some useless variables, such as state FIPS codes and county FIPS codes. This article removes them before data processing. In addition, the paper added the latitude and longitude of each listing, allowing the study to perform map visualization analysis and match each listing to traffic conditions based on geographic coordinates.
